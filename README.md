#  Joyce CSS

JoyceCSS is an OOCSS framework with a rock-solid reset, useful layouts, an infinitely flexible and adaptive grid with heaps of helpers to mix, match and customise to your design.

## Getting Started

- Run the watch command to ensure your SASS is compiled correctly
- Update the default settings file css/\_settings.scss
- Customise your sites style by updating the files in css/custom
- Read the code for index.html to learn how to structure your page and get the
  most out of OOCSS and Joyce.

## How it works

The SASS version of Joyce CSS is composed of three main parts.

The helpers folder contains the reset styling, generic styles for things like
forms and OOCSS objects like media and module.


The \_settings.scss file contains default variables for things like maximum page
width, adaptive layout break points and default spacing.

The custom folder contains the styling for things like background color, font
color, font sizes and buttons. You should customise the code in this folder and
add any additional styling to this folder.
