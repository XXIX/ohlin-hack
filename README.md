#  Stencil.css

This is not another CSS framework. It's a set of lightweight CSS helpers to give you a head start developing your next web site.

## What you get
+ 3 font sizes
+ 3 font weights
+ OOCSS helpers for layout, modules and media objects
+ Responsive OOCSS styles for palm, lap and desk widths


## Getting Started

- Run the watch command to ensure your Sass stylesheet is compiled
- Update css/_settings.scss with your preferences
- Customise css/_mixins.scss with your preferred styles
- Place all custom CSS in css/_custom.scss

## How it works

The css/helpers folder contains the reset styling, generic styles for things like forms and OOCSS objects like media and module.

The css/_settings.scss file contains default variables all 'out of the box' objects and styles.

The css/_mixins.scss file contains customisable snippets for objects like buttons.

The css/_custom.scss file is an empty file ready for all your custom CSS.
