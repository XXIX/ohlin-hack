#  JoyceCSS

JoyceCSS is an OOCSS framework with a rock-solid reset, useful layouts, an infinitely flexible and adaptive grid with heaps of helpers to mix, match and customise to your design.

## Getting Started

- Run the watch command to ensure your Sass is compiled correctly
- Update css/_joyce.scss with your preferences
- Customise css/_mixins.scss with your preferred styles
- Place all custom CSS in css/_custom.scss

## How it works

The css/helpers folder contains the reset styling, generic styles for things like forms and OOCSS objects like media and module.

The css/_joyce.scss file contains default variables all 'out of the box' objects and styles.

The css/_mixins.scss file contains customisable snippets for objects like buttons.

The css/_custom.scss file is an empty file ready for all your custom CSS.
